# usercad

It's a experimental software to creating and deleting users data and save it to your
hard disk.
Everything is written in C, uses Meson as compiler and Gnome Builder as IDE. For
now it only runs on Linux-based systems due to exclusives lib such as `<unistd.h>`

Feel free to use anything here to your own projetcs and research.
